# Lock file
# The dependency lock file (.terraform.lock.hcl) should be committed to source control.
# However, if you are working in a heterogeneous environment (Windows, macOS, Linux),
# you may need to add it to .gitignore and manage it with `terraform providers lock`
# for cross-platform checksums, or just ignore it in a personal setup to always get the newest provider version.
# The general recommendation is to include it for consistent dependency versions across teams.
# .terraform.lock.hcl

# Terraform state files
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*
# You should use a remote backend for state management instead of committing state files.

# Crash log files
crash.log

# Ignore any .tfvars files that are generated automatically for each Terraform run.
# Most .tfvars files are managed as part of configuration and so should be included in
# version control.
#
# However, files containing sensitive data, such as production secrets, should be ignored.
# A common pattern is to ignore all .tfvars files by default, then use a negated pattern
# to explicitly include an example or non-sensitive one (e.g., !example.tfvars).
# *.tfvars
# *.tfvars.json

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally
# and so are not checked in.
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json
# If you do wish to add an override file to version control, use a negated pattern
# (e.g., !example_override.tf).

# Include plan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
# example: *tfplan*

# Ignore CLI configuration files
.terraformrc
terraform.rc

# Ignore a specific file named 'credentials' (or similar) that might contain sensitive information.
